#Bicycle/Pedestrian Count Application

According to the [National Bicycle and Pedestrian Documentation Project](bikepeddocumentation.org), "One of the greatest challenges facing the bicycle and pedestrian field is the lack of documentation of usage and demand. Without accurate and consistent demand and usage figures, it is difficult to measure the positive benefits of investments in these modes, especially when compared to the other transportation modes such as the private automobile."
So the idea is that if we can prove demand for better bike/pedestrian infrastructure, the city will be more likely to spend money on it. They are usually done every one to two years. Based on the information available from the most recent local bicycle pedestrian count (in September, 2014) at <movingomaha.org>, there are approximately 25 locations, for a total of 125 - 250 volunteer shifts for each count. The data is used by the City of Omaha Planning Department and Public Works to identify usage of city facilities as well as the locations of high use in order to improve conditions for cyclists and pedestrians as the need arises. [ModeShift Omaha](modeshiftomaha.org), as a local nonprofit advocating for equality in transportation options, is working to assist in the facilitation of a yearly bicycle pedestrian count going forward.

The counts are presently done on paper following the methodology of the National Bicycle and Pedestrian Documentation Project. Each volunteer makes tick marks in the appropriate box to indicate a cyclist or pedestrian that has passed a selected point in his/her field of view. Each volunteer has a two-hour shift, which is broken into 15 minute time intervals on the sheet. An example count form is available [here](http://movingomaha.org/images/stories/content/Counts/Instruction_sheet/009_16andCapitol.pdf).

Challenges of this method of data collection include:
<<<<<<< HEAD
  - Imprecise transfer of data from the paper count sheets to the tracking system
  - Difficult/tedious data transfer
  - Volunteers losing/failing to turn in count sheets

The goal here is an application that makes collection and transfer of data easier.

Constraints
<<<<<<< HEAD
  1. Volunteers should be able to enter and edit their own data, but not have access to the data of any other user.
  2. Volunteers should not be able to add/delete profiles or edit the location assigned to his/her profile.

User Flow
  1. Admin creates the user and a temporary password.
  2. Volunteer logs in and can update password.
  3. On the day of the count, the volunteer may:
    * Log in on a mobile device, if available, and enter data directly.
    * Collect data on paper form and enter the data once the shift is over.

Needs
  1. A mobile website would be useful.
  2. Two static information pages available within each user profile:
    * Instructions and contact information
    * Map of the specific location where the user signed up to count
